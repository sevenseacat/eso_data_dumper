Account-wide:

  ☐ Include in-line achievements in the category and sub-category totals
     eg. "Provisioning" is listed as 5, but it actually has 7 because "Recipe Book"
     and "Recipe Compendium" are in-line after "Recipe Card"
  ☐ Include Achievement criteria
  ☐ Include Achievement rewards
  ☐ Find some way to get icons for both categories and sub-categories...

Character-specific:

  ☐ List each achievement ID, with the timestamp of their achievement.
